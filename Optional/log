-----  ------------   -----------  ---------------
9/22     5:00pm          2:00       Read assignment and tried to understand the spec fully. Later on looked at the starter code and went though it
9/23     7:00pm          3:00       Went to office hours to get help with understanding the different files for the assignment and where to get started
9/24     4:00pm          1:00       Went to Prof. Glenn to get help with starting over because I couldn't get past reading the file- he recommended 
                                    I can start writing the heuristic functions and use the given array to test it.
9/25     10:00pm         2:00       At the Sailathon, I got help from cs223 staff to do nearest and a bit of insert heuristics
9/27     9:00pm          2:00       Finished up all my other functions except the read file.
9/28     9:00pm          2:00       implementing my man function even though read file function was not working fully
9/29     1:00pm          3:00       Got help from TAs fihuring out the issue with my read file function
9/30     11:30am         3:30       I wasn't passing around 12 test cases so I went to office hours to get help with that- figured out I was reading some 
                                    invalid files. After figuring that I was left with some 6 test cases that were because of memory leaks in my code therefore     
                                    not passing the valgrind test. Figured out I was allocating memory in read file but forgot to free it. Got solved
                        ------
                         18:30      TOTAL time spent

I got all the help I needed for this assignment from my TAs and professors

DISCUSSION

This assignment was intensive as it had a lot of things to handle. Implementation along with dealing with memory management and debugging was indeed hectic. The most 
challenging bits for me was implementing neares and insert functions. It required a clear understanding of the problem and strategizing to crack it.On top of that, 
implementing and testing the different heuristics was challenging, because I would realise my code is not working correctly after spending hours trying to write it. I encountered 
several issues while trying to parse and read data from files because there were a couple of conditions to check to determine the validity of a file. Memory management was also 
another significant focus; tracking dynamically allocated memory and freeing it appropriately required meticulous attention to avoid memory leaks. Since it was my first time using 
a tool like valgrind, I had to spend time with TAs tring to understand the valgrind errors whenever I tried running the test cases. Overall, the assignment was a valuable learning 
experience, reinforcing the importance of carefil planning, systematic testing, and effective debugging techniques.
